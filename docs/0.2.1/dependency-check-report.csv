In versions prior to 4.1.129.Final and 4.2.8.Final, the `io.netty.handler.codec.http.HttpRequestEncoder` has a CRLF injection with the request URI when constructing a request. This leads to request smuggling when `HttpRequestEncoder` is used without proper sanitization of the URI. Any application / framework using `HttpRequestEncoder` can be subject to be abused to perform request smuggling using CRLF injection. Versions 4.1.129.Final and 4.2.8.Final fix the issue.",NVD,"","","",MEDIUM,6.5,CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:3.9/RC:R/MAV:A,"","","",HIGH,35,"","","","","","","",""
